# Fieldtype

The Recurrence Rule fieldtype is the heart of the plugin. This fieldtype allows you to define 1 entry for "every second Tuesday of the month", for example. We provide an elegant UI that is fully compliant to the iCalendar ([RFC5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10)).

The fieldtype allows you define hourly, weekly, monthly, and yearly events. The follow are some examples and screenshots of what is possible in the fieldtype

## Define Hourly Events

For example, repeat every 2 hours and end after 2 occurrences.
